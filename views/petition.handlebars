        <h1>Milk Before Cereal</h1>
        <!-- <h1>You've been eating your cereal wrong</h1> -->
        <!-- <p>According to the research of leading professors of International University for Breakfast Sciences, only 8 percent of people eat their cereal right. Join our movement and spread a sacred knowledge throughout the world: Milk Before Cereal!</p> -->
            <!-- <p>You pour cereal before milk. This makes it hard to see how much milk youâ€™re pouring, so you almost always end up with a pool of it at the bottom of the bowl. For a better cereal-to-milk ratio, pour the milk first and top with a scoop of cereal
            </p> -->
